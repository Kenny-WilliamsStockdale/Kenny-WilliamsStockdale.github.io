## WEB503 A3 

This assessment for me required a lot of quick study and learning on my part especially when it came to injecting JavaScript into my existing assessment 2 project. JavaScript is something I have had very little experience with so trying to produce a dynamic website with functionality included was a big challenge. I was lucky and very thankful in receiving help from my tutor and other class students both of which were much more knowledgeable in JavaScript and helped me in understanding the basics of how JavaScript functions along with beginning to code to make my a3 project dynamic. 

Beginning this project, I realised that I would have to refactor several pages to allow for the webpage to be dynamic and have features and functionality that users would expect typically of a webstore. This started with my sign up and log in page. I changed the layout of these pages and added functionality to the login and create an account button and links. This allows users to sign up on a popup modal page and save that information to local storage. They then could log in with their stored details and it will redirect them to the home page.

The design choice I made for A3 I feel was a better option visually and much more efficient for adding functionality. Using JavaScript code from a class project made this an easier task and helped me understand how and why the code functioned. 

I made a similar choice to another page which was my payment/ cart page.

This was a much different design that has a cart and more in-depth payment and billing options. I selected which fields from the shipping billing form would be pushed to the local storage for later reference.

Learning local storage was a good challenge and the commands were quite straightforward I felt. I found it interesting in testing out how information was stored amongst my pages and how the browser was able to restore and retrieve data. 

The harder task was getting my cart to work and have products populate and tally the cart. This took a lot of understanding and work. I had help from a fellow student who taught me how the code for the cart functions and ran me through the step by step process of how it would get items from the product page and push them to local storage then pull them back out and populate the cart. 

Pulling from product page to store in local storage and create cart:

From there my payment page would load the cart to the DOM along with values of item name, price and quantity and calculate the total price of products in the cart. After all this code was put in place and tested successfully, I spent time on trying to work through and complete my understanding of it. Being in a position of a mid-year intake student and missing out on classes tailored to vanilla JavaScript earlier in the year I feel itâ€™s essential for me to continually learn and practice coding in JavaScript so I can feel confident on my ability to write and understand it in any future projects.
